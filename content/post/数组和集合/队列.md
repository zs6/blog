# Queue<T>(FIFO)

```python
from collections import deque  
  
intQueue = deque()  
intQueue.append(1)  
intQueue.append(3)  
intQueue.append(5)  
  
first = intQueue.popleft()  
# first is 1  
second = intQueue.popleft()  
# second is 3  
third = intQueue.popleft()  
# third is 5  
  
print(first)  
print(second)  
print(third)
```

```java
Queue<Integer> intQueue = new LinkedList<Integer>();  
intQueue.add(1);  
intQueue.add(3);  
intQueue.add(5);  
  
int top = intQueue.peek();  
//top is 1  
int first = intQueue.poll();  
//first is 1  
int second = intQueue.poll();  
//second is 3  
int third = intQueue.poll();  
//third is 5
```

```javascript
var intQueue = [];  
intQueue.push(1);  
intQueue.push(3);  
intQueue.push(5);  
  
var top = intQueue[0];  
//top is 1  
var first = intQueue.shift();  
//first is 1  
var second = intQueue.shift();  
//second is 3  
var third = intQueue.shift();  
//third is 5
```

```cs
var intQueue = new Queue<int>();  
intQueue.Enqueue(1);  
intQueue.Enqueue(3);  
intQueue.Enqueue(5);  
  
var top = intQueue.Peek();  
//top is 1  
var first = intQueue.Dequeue();  
//first is 1  
var second = intQueue.Dequeue();  
//second is 3  
var third = intQueue.Dequeue();  
//third is 5
```

```go
type queue []int  
  
func (q queue) Push(v int) queue {  
return append(q, v)  
}  
  
func (q queue) Shift() (queue, int) {  
return q[1:], q[0]  
}  
  
intQueue := make(queue, 0)  
intQueue = intQueue.Push(1)  
intQueue = intQueue.Push(3)  
intQueue = intQueue.Push(5)  
  
intQueue, first := intQueue.Shift()  
//first is 1  
intQueue, second := intQueue.Shift()  
//second is 3  
intQueue, third := intQueue.Shift()  
//third is 5
